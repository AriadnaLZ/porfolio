So when I finished high school I decided to do a Master's Degree in Digital Photography and Lighting. 
  Currently, a few months ago I decided to delve into the world of programming, I started taking some Python courses and discovered how much fun it seemed to me. I left my job, which had nothing to do with this world, and embarked on this new adventure by taking a Full Stack Developer course, in ThePowerMBA's Rock the Code program.`
